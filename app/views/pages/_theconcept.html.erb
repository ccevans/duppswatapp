		<p> dupp&swat's second location is located camp north end. </br> </br>Urban Ministry Center (UMC) has been a fixture in Charlotte since 1994 providing basic services (soup kitchen, showers, laundry, mail) for our neighbors experiencing homelessness; today they continue to help people on a path out of homelessness with those services, but have also hit on the answer to ending chronic homelessness. The Housing First Charlotte Mecklenburg initiative is a partnership of 28 nonprofits, government offices, churches and corporations managed by Urban Ministry Center. Together they have worked to house over 533 chronically homeless individuals since they began in February 2015. As the initiative wraps up they are asking the community for help in providing 200 Welcome Home Kits to help the remaining chronically homeless individuals find their way to a new home.

		<h1>the concept</h1>

		<p>Our newest addition, DUPP&SWAT: THE CONCEPT is located at 1824 Statesville Ave, Ste 109 (Raceway Building @ Camp North End) and operates in a different vein than 'THE STUDIO.' Coined 'THE CONCEPT,' the theme and, therefore, look of the space will transform every six months as we collaborate with various individuals and organizations for curating purposes. More, themes will vary from 'real, harsh, and heavy' to 'crazy, quirky and over-the-top' to create an experience unlike any in Charlotte. Here, the goal is to partner with entities to further propel their mission and purpose over the course. And, in addition to taking donations on behalf of the guest collaborator, they are allowed to use our space for specific events associated with their purpose. </br></br>Feel free to contact us at info@duppandswat.com if you have questions/comments.</p>
